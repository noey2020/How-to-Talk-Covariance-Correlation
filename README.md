Covariance and correlation are good cousins when it comes to establishing
relationships between datasets. Correlation is the bailiwick of data science.
We are concerned about telling stories about how variables behave and will 
behave. Covariance covers 2 variables and when extended to more than 2, we 
use covariance matrix. Data science is using correlation, linear algebra,
statistics, linear regression, loss functions, and cross-validation to paint
data stories. Big data is when your dataset is so huge that computer memory 
cannot operate on it right away and you have to divide it into smaller
multiple datasets.

So why are covariance and correlation used. When you have positive correlation,
it means variable x is increasing and so will variable y. With a negative
correlation, variable x and variable y have inverse relationship. Zero means
they are unrelated.

Whatever the variables x & y stand for like stock prices or returns or 
debt/equity ratios, you can take advantage of the statistical tools & measures
you have to create a portfolio or risk mix.

The moral of the story is to use these free analytical tools to your advantage.

Thanks for reading my two cents!
